notes: 
	padding format is [left right top bottom]

	#'s in filename are turned into numbers when saving in numbered order, more #'s means more zeros, one means just the number, else it's just apphended to the end

	the name table and truthmask can be stored in seperate files (even cfg!)

	set the "transparentFrameBg" to false if your item background is opaque (this is a hack to dumb alpha blending issues surfaces have in Gamemaker)

please report any bugs found to my email
